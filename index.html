                <h2>Importance of Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p>Cybersecurity is critical in our increasingly digital world. As new types of attacks are developed, cybersecurity needs to be updated continually through updating defensive hardware and software, making backup copies of important data, and instituting business recovery policies.</p>
                
                <div class="important-box">
                    <p>A defensive stance involves adopting an attitude and implementing strategies that make it challenging for attackers to compromise your digital life, safety, financial security, and privacy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Effective cybersecurity means that data resides on personal computers attached to the network, and local security on all computers is important to foil attacks that breach the perimeter.</p>
            </section>
            
            <section id="challenges">
                <h2>Challenges in Cybersecurity</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Protecting personal computers is challenging</li>
                    <li>Many different types of attacks exist today, and attacks are constantly modified</li>
                    <li>New attacks are created regularly</li>
                    <li>No single defensive program exists - several different defenses must be in place</li>
                    <li>Specific technical skills are needed to counteract these attacks</li>
                    <li>Due to increased complexity of operating systems, unintentional vulnerabilities could be exploited by hackers</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Operating System Updates</h3>
                <p>To address security issues, operating system vendors often put out updates through an automatic update service. These patches are software updates to address security issues.</p>

                <h2>Social Engineering</h2>
                <p>Social engineering involves impersonation (identity fraud) and then playing out the role of that person on a victim. To appear genuine, the attacker must know something about the victim.</p>

                    <p>Example: An attacker could impersonate a help desk support technician and call the victim pretending there is a problem with the network. They would usually ask for the victim's username and password to reset the account.</p>

                <h2>Malware Types</h2>
                <p><strong>Malware</strong> is software that enters a computer system without the owner's knowledge or consent, performing unwanted and usually harmful actions. The number of instances of malware is staggering, as it continues to evolve to avoid detection.</p>
                
                <h3>Ransomware</h3>
                <p>Malicious software that "kidnaps" a user's computer and holds it "hostage" until a ransom is paid. Not easily traceable, as most cases use cryptocurrency. Top four targets: education, retail, business and professional services, government.</p>
                
                <div class="attack-types">

                        <p>A more malicious form that encrypts files (encrypting only some helps to evade detection).</p>
                        <p>The attacker demands payment to provide decryption keys. Often the key either increases in price over time or is unable to be purchased after a certain period.</p>
                        <p>A decryption tool is delivered in 99% of current cases. New variants can also encrypt files on connected devices/networks.</p>

                <h2>Mobile Security</h2>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Mobile devices now account for over half of users' daily computing time, leading to phenomena like <strong>"nomophobia"</strong> (fear of being without a phone). This reliance makes wireless networks and the devices themselves prime targets for attackers seeking to capture unprotected signals and data.</p>
                
                <h3>Part 1: Attacks on Wireless Networks</h3>
                <p>Wireless networks are a critical vulnerability point. The main types are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Near Field Communication (NFC).</p>
